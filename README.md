This is my first React Project!!!.

A second version of todos, but It's made with react and have less features, but better code 😏.

| Config   | []    |
| TaskList | []    |
| Task     | [x]   |

## Features

### React

- This app is made fully with React hooks.

### Others

- I added the drag&drop api although it's not so useful here 😅.

## Notes

- The design isn't responsive 😐😐😐.
- You can drag a task by dragging any part of its body (not as I wanted).
