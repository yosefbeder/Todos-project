# todos-project-v2

---

## Overview

---

This is my first React Project!!!.

A second version of todos, but It's made with react and have less features, but better code 😏.

## Components

---

| Name     | Type        | State |
| -------- | ----------- | ----- |
| App      | class-based | [x]   |
| Nav      | functional  | [ ]   |
| Config   | functional  | [ ]   |
| TaskList | functional  | [ ]   |
| Task     | functional  | [x]   |
| Form     | class-based | [x]   |

## Features

---

### React

- I used all of React posible **Hooks** useState, useEffect, useRef.
- I also used **conditional rendering**, **shouldComponentUpdate**, and **context api**.

### Others

- I added the drag&drop api although it's not so useful here 😅.

## Notes

---

- The design isn't responsive 😐😐😐.
- You can drag a task by dragging any part of its body (not as I wanted).
